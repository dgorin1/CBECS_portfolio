    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook summarizes the results of a project to predict commercial building energy consumption using the 2018 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) dataset. The primary goal is to identify the key drivers of energy use and build an accurate predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting energy consumption is crucial for building owners, utilities, and policymakers to benchmark performance, identify opportunities for energy efficiency improvements, and support broader climate goals. This analysis compares several modeling techniques, from simple linear models to more complex ensembles, to determine the most effective approach."

    "## 2. Data Overview and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is based on the **CBECS 2018** microdata. The target variable for this project is `MFBTU`, which represents the total annual energy consumption from all major fuels in thousands of BTUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Variable Transformation\n",
    "As seen in the exploratory data analysis, the `MFBTU` variable is highly right-skewed. To stabilize variance and make the distribution more suitable for linear models, a log transformation was applied. The new target variable, `LOG_MFBTU`, was used for all modeling efforts."

    "### Preprocessing and Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline was developed, which included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Values:** Imputing or creating indicator variables for missing data based on context from the CBECS codebook.\n",
    "- **Recoding Special Values:** Standardizing coded values (e.g., for confidentiality or top-coding) into meaningful numeric representations.\n",
    "- **Feature Transformation:** Applying log or square-root transforms to skewed numeric features (e.g., `SQFT` -> `SQFT_log1p`).\n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into a machine-readable format.\n",
